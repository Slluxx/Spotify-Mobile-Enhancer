This extension makes use of Spotify's desktop version and re-models it back into a mobile UI. This means we get all the desktop features and are not limiting ourselfs with the mobile experience. 

- Background playback
- Unlimited songs
- Any playstyle (shuffle, sequential, repeat, ...)
- Seek to any point
- Library management
- Adblock

Soon:
- Fixed media controls (lockscreen / notification buttons)
