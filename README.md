# Spotify Mobile Enhancer

This extension makes use of Spotify's desktop version and re-models it back into a mobile UI. This means we get all the desktop features and are not limiting ourselfs with the mobile experience. 

Get it on [Firefox AMO for android] and join our [Discord Server](http://discord.gg/ADHdD3MGgX) for news, help or feature requests!


Currently Working:

- Background playback
- Unlimited songs
- Any playstyle (shuffle, sequential, repeat, ...)
- Seek to any point
- Library management
- Adblock

Soon:

- Fixed media controls (lockscreen / notification buttons)


## How to use it

- Download Firefox for android and [browse here download the extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/spotifymobileenhancer/)
- Browse to [https://open.spotify.com/](https://open.spotify.com/)
- Make sure that DRM content playback is enabled (Shield icon in the top left)
- Enable desktop mode (3 dots menu in the top right)
- Tap the screen and listen to your music!

### Tip

If you set a homescreen shortcut, you do not need to enable desktop mode. It is like using an app.
